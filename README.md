### Branch naming convention

There are four types of branches that can be created/pushed - feature, bug, chore and hotfix.

Feature - for pushing new feature(s). Ideally, we should push one feature in a branch.

Bug - for pushing bug fixes of existing features. Ideally, we should avoid fixing multiple bugs in one branch.

Chore - for pushing routine tasks such as updating a library across the whole repo or a non-critical code cleanup.

Hotfix - for pushing critical fixes that require immediate merging.

### Rules for naming a branch:

## branch-type/MMYY/collaborator-name/description

Eg. bug/0824/john/modal-background-color-change

Happy coding!
