## Branch naming convention

There are three types of branches that can be created/pushed - feature, bug and chore.

Feature - for pushing new feature(s). Ideally, we should push one feature in a branch.
Bug - for pushing bug fixes of existing features. Ideally, we should avoid fixing multiple bugs in one branch.
Chore - for pushing routine tasks such as updating a library across the whole repo or a non-critical code cleanup.

Rules for naming a branch:

## <branch-type>/<MM-YY>/<collaborator-name>/<description>

Eg. bug/08-24/john/modal-background-color-change

Happy coding!
